            <p>This is Arbus, a self-taught astronaut (just kidding). A space enthusiaist who enjoys to visualize the vibe around space with the help of humble animations. I just started to build this project (a couple of months ago) and I am excited to take it to the next level and make more publicly available data for the community.</p>

            <br />
            <p>Would love to hear your comments/critique/offers if you have any. Feel free to hit me up at <a href="mailto:arbus@multiplanetary.website">arbus@multiplanetary.website</a></p>

            <p className="yavash">Some technical details: the website is built on React, nothing fancy simple HTML, CSS (yep, the animations are CSS-only too). I offer freelance web-dev services as well. Feel free to contact if you're interested in.</p>
