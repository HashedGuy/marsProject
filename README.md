# multiplanetary.website

The multiplanetary.website is an interesting attempt to visualize the progresses happening to make human beings multiplanetary species. The project includes daily updates on Martian photos, people in space, launch schedule for rocket operators, as well as a pseudo-simulation visualising potential gravity in different cellestial bodies.
